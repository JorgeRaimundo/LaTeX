## Description

So far this project consists in isolated attpempts to create small documents. To properly generate the final documents, you must have installed the [EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/) font that you can download from the the font's page or from the `fonts`folder in this project.

## Environment

All files were meant to be compiled by [TeXworks](https://www.tug.org/texworks/) using XeLaTeX via [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/)
